# Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) Regression

OLS is a "method that allows to find a line that best describes the
relationship between one or more predictor variables and a response
variable" [@howtop], with our end result being:

$$
\hat{y} = b_0 + b_1x
$$

The best fitting line is typically calculated utilizing the least
squares, which can be visually described as the deviation in the
vertical direction.

Now, we will examine the
relationship between a vehicle's weight (WT) and its miles per gallon or
fuel efficiency (MPG).

In a previous lesson, we found a Pearson's
correlation coefficient of r(30) = -0.868, p\<0.05. Based on this
information, we concluded that there is a strong negative relationship
between MPG and WT. Where, heavier vehicles are associated with lower
miles per gallon. Essentially this means that heavier vehicles are less
fuel efficient. We will use the interpretation of this correlation as
the basis of building an OLS regression to predict the value of MPG for
a vehicle based on its weight. An OLS regression could be described as a
common method used in regression analysis due to its efficiency in
fitting the best straight line through a set of points. Thus, an OLS
regression model gives best approximate of true population regression
line as it minimizes the total distance from all of the points to the
line.

The OLS model could be expressed as:
$$\hat{y}_i = \beta_0 + \beta_1x_i$$

Then the OLS regression model line for our example is:

$$\widehat{MPG_i} = \beta_0 +\beta_1*WT_i$$

-   **The line has the following properties:**

    > The intercept ($\beta_0$), its measure is defined by the units
    > in Y. In our case, the units used in MPG. It is the predicted
    > value of Y (MPG) when X (WT) is zero

    > The slope ($\beta_1$), is the predicted change in Y for a one-unit
    > increase in X. Like the correlation coefficient, it provides
    > information on the relationship between X and Y. But unlike the
    > correlation coefficient (unitless), it highlights the relationship
    > in real terms of units. In our example this would look at how
    > miles per gallon increase or decrease for a one unit increase in a
    > vehicle's weight (according to the R docummentation for the
    > `mtcars` data set, weight is provided as a measure per every 1,000
    > pounds and miles per gallon are provided as Miles/(US) gallon),
    > therefore the units are defined by the Y (MPG) and the X (WT).

    > -   For example, the data for a vehicle that weighs 2,000 pounds
    >     the unit is given as "2"
    > -   For example, a vehicle that spends one gallon of fuel per
    >     every 19 miles is given as "19"

## How to develop the best fitting line?

![Sample residual/error terms plot](04_regression_residuals.jpg)

The best fitting line is one that minimizes errors in prediction or one
with the Minimum sum of squared residuals (SSR). For more details, you
can watch this video: [@khanacademy2018]

$$
SSR = \sum_{i = 1}^{n}{(y_i - \hat{y_i})^2}
$$

$residual_i = y_i - \hat{y_i}$

It is important to note that prior to calculating the residuals, we must
visualize and examine the data, which was done in the previous example.
Then, we must run the regression line. We can utilize lm() to perform
the OLS regression which will provide us with the model summary,
including the following:

> Pr(\>\|t\|) Multiple R-Squared Adjusted R-Squared Residual Standard
> Error F-statistic P-value

Once the model summary is given, we can then move on to creating the
residual plots. When performing this step, we have to check the
assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality.

```         
* Residuals = error terms
* $$ Residual = observed value - predicted value $$
* The larger the error term in absolute value, the worse the prediction
* Squaring residuals solve issues arising from some residuals being negative and some positive.
```

-   **Assumptions**
    1.  ***Linearity:*** Linear relationship between the dependent
        variable and the independent variables.

    2.  ***Independence:*** The observations must be independent of each
        other.

    3.  ***Homoscedasticity:*** The variance of the residuals should be
        constant across all levels of the independent variables.

    4.  ***Normality:*** The residuals / errors should be normally
        distributed.

    5.  ***No multicollinearity:*** In the case of multiple regression
        (2+ independent variables), the independent variables should not
        be highly correlated with each other.

## Example of an OLS regression in R

In R, the `lm` function command allows us to develop an OLS regression.

```{r}
#| label: OLS regression mpg~wt
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false

# model predicting mpg (fuel efficiency) using wt (weight)
MPGReg <- lm(mpg ~ wt, data = mtcars)
summary(MPGReg)
```

The OLS regression model is then:

$\widehat{MPG_i} = 37.285 - 5.344*WT_i$

-   **Interpretation:** $\beta_0$

    -   The model predicts that vehicles with no weight will have 37.285
        miles per gallon, on average.

    -   This is not a very meaningful intercept as vehicles with "0"
        weight do not exist. A meaningful intercept can be created by
        subtracting a constant from the *x* variable to move the
        intercept.In R as part of the `lm` command, this can be done by
        surrounding the independent variable with `I()` which applies
        the function inside and treats it as a new variable. For our
        example we used the rounded lowest weight of the data (1.5) to
        predict miles per gallon.

        > This procedure does not change the slope of the line

```{r}
#| label: OLS regression mpg~wt I()
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false

# model predicting mpg (fuel efficiency) using wt (weight)
MPGReg2 <- lm(mpg ~ I(wt-1.5), data = mtcars)
summary(MPGReg2)
```

-   Then, the meaningful intercept model predicts that vehicles with a
    weight of 1500 pounds have 29.268 miles per gallon, on average.

-   **Interpretation:** $\beta_1$

    -   The model predicts that on average, an increase of 1,000 pounds
        in the weight of a vehicle is associated with a decrease of
        5.344 miles per gallon.

```{r}
#| label: Creating Residual Plots
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false

# define residuals 
res <- resid(MPGReg)

# produce residual vs. fitted plot 
plot(fitted(MPGReg), res)

# add a horizontal line at 0
abline(0,0)

# create Q-Q- plot for residuals
qqnorm(res)

# add a straight diagonal line to the plot
qqline(res)

```

Based on the graph above, it is visually clear that normality may not be
met due to some outliers. This means that we must explore our data even
deeper as it is possible that transformation of our data utilizing one
of the following methods must take place:

> Log transformation Square Root Transformation Cube Root Transformation

Once the data is transformed, we can run the residual plot over again in
order to achieve normality. For the sake of this presentation, we are
only using an example with known limitations such as non-normality.

## Hypothesis testing in OLS regression

The null hypothesis in this case would be that the slope is zero
indicating no relationship between x and y. Or in our example, we can
state that there is no relationship between a vehicle's weight and its
miles per gallon. The alternative hypothesis is then that the slope is
not zero.

$$
H_0: \beta_1 = 0
$$

$$
H_1: \beta_1 ≠ 0 
$$

We can test this hypothesis by using the `lm summary` printout which
provides the p-value for the `wt` coefficient. This indicates that there
is indeed a significant relationship between the weight of the car and
its efficiency (miles per gallon used). R provides a t-value for the
'wt' coefficient which has a p-value of p \< 0.000 as seen below:

```         
                  Estimate        Std. Error       t value      Pr(>|t|)   
    wt           -5.3445             0.5591       -9.559       1.29e-10
```

## R-Squared Value

R-squared is "a measure of how much of the variation in the dependent
variable is explained by the independent variables in the model. It
ranges from 0 to 1, with higher values indicating a better fit"
[@ordinary].

Adjusted R-squared is "similar to R-squared, but it takes into account
the number of independent variables in the model. It is a more
conservative estimate of the model's fit, as it penalizes the addition
of variables that do not improve the model's performance" [@ordinary].

## F-Statistic

The F-statistic "tests the overall significance of the model by
comparing the variation in the dependent variable explained by the model
to the variation not explained by the model. A large F-statistic
indicates that the model as a whole is significant"[@interpre].

## Visual representation

The visual representation of this model using `ggplot` is the following:

```{r}
#| label: Visual representation of MPGReg
#| echo: true
#| code-fold: false

ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg))+
  geom_point()+
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE)+ #se is option for coinfidence bar
  labs(x= "Weight (per 1,000 pounds)",
       y = "Miles per gallon")+
  theme_bw()
```

As shown in the figure above, we see the summary statistics represented
in a visual manner with the line of best fit. As indicated previously,
we see a steep negative correlation between weight of the car and the
miles per gallon (efficiency) utilized.
