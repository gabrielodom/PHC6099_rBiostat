               the most precise and least biased effect sizes calculations in a
               variety of conditions. The results show that there is no big
               difference to obtain effect sizes of using mean difference or
               trimmed mean difference as denominator. Cohen's dA proves to be
               the less unbiased but more precise across all the conditions in
               Welch t test. It is worthwhile to notice that Hedges' g remains
               the same as Cohen's dP across all the conditions of Welch t
               test. When group sample sizes are equal, no matter which
               population effect size formula are applied, Cohen's dA, Cohen's
               dP, and Hedges' g are the same estimates given the bias

  title     = "Central limit theorem: the cornerstone of modern statistics",

  abstract  = "According to the central limit theorem, the means of a random
               sample of size, n, from a population with mean, µ, and variance,
               $\sigma$2, distribute normally with mean, µ, and variance,
               [Formula: see text]. Using the central limit theorem, a variety
               of parametric tests have been developed under assumptions about
               the parameters that determine the population probability
               distribution. Compared to non-parametric tests, which do not
               require any assumptions about the population probability
               distribution, parametric tests produce more accurate and precise
               estimates with higher statistical powers. However, many medical
               researchers use parametric tests to present their data without
               knowledge of the contribution of the central limit theorem to
               the development of such tests. Thus, this review presents the
               basic concepts of the central limit theorem and its role in
               binomial distributions and the Student's t-test, and provides an
               example of the sampling distributions of small populations. A
               proof of the central limit theorem is also described with the
               mathematical concepts required for its near-complete
               understanding.",
